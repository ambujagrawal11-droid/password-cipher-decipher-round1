# password-cipher-decipher-round1
This project aims at ciphering/encrypting the password input to a key and further deciphers/decrypts it and verifies it while login.
How it Works
1. User creates a password.
2. The system encrypts it using a Caesar shift.
3. During login, the entered password is encrypted again.
4. If both encrypted values match → access granted.
